# README

This project evolved from my life lasting love to curly hair and curly hair care.
It is only supposed to show the basic idea of what I am able to code in Rails.

Future improvements of my service:

* Quiz on hair porosity 

* Database improvements, including adding new categories and existing ingredients' smaller divisions

* A user-friendlier view, like colors and images
